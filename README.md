# DescTradingBot
Steam Trading bot for Team Fortress 2 Description tags, using the Steam Platform.

Written for an old version of node-steam and node-steam-trade, so might not work with current versions.

# Dependencies
- Node.js
- node-steam

# Installing correct versions of npm modules 

## Node-steam
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-steam
- npm uninstall steam
- npm install steam@v0.6.8

## Node-steam-trade
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-steam-trade
- I'm not certain if this is compatible with the current version of node-steam-trade, so if you want to run this, you will have to work this out yourself, sorry!
